# Online-Hate-Text-Classifier 
In todayâ€™s generation, everyone is connected through the internet. We can share information, support each other but there are downsides as well. Online hate is a major threat to social media platforms. It is classified into:
* Abusive language
* Provocation
* Aggression
* Racism
* Cyberbullying
* Hatefulness
* Threats
* Insult
* Toxicity
* Personal attacks
There is a way to remove this negativity. We will detect the above issues and remove them with the help of machine learning and automated processes.
\We will develop a web application that will detect hateful content from a sentence and tell if the sentence is offensive. The word is stated as offensive depending on the context of the word in the sentence.

In this project, we are created a model which will work as follows:
Sentence/comment to be posted on social media is typed.
It will be matched with our dataset containing thousands of words/phrases that are offensive.
If the pattern is similar, the comment will not be allowed to be posted online.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/mrinaal007/hate-speech-detection?select=toxic_train.csv
A number of datasets are used for training, testing, and evaluation of hate speech detection.The datasets differ in various perspectives such as the number of comments, language used,etc.Goal is to see and apply various techniques used in NLP to classify toxic comments made on various online platform. Dataset is modified from the original dataset presented in one original Kaggle Competition where it was a multiclass classification. However, this dataset would serve as a good starting point for people who are beginners in the field of NLP.
